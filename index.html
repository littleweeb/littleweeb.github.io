							<h3>Why?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>LittleWeeb is the only way to watch anime. Every season, you will be able to access a beautiful application with every single series on it. You choose the ones you want to watch by marking them as favorites and then you watch, simple. Any work you had to do before, finding a tracker/thinking of a unique username/downloading a torrent with seeds/figuring out where to store it/finding it again when you want to watch it/naming the file, we'll handle that for you!</p>
